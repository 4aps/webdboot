# 📘 JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This repo contains my practice and exploration of core JavaScript concepts. It's a growing collection of small scripts and examples that demonstrate how different parts of JavaScript work — especially focusing on asynchronous programming.

## ✅ What’s Covered So Far

### 🔁 Async Functions & Promises
- Converted traditional callback-based functions to promise-based.
- Chained `.then()` and `.catch()` for cleaner async code.
- Simulated real-world scenarios with `setTimeout`, file I/O, and more.
- Practiced error handling with `try...catch`.

> 📝 Example: A script that reads a file, trims extra spaces, writes it back, waits, and reads again — all using promises.
